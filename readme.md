These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Included with Docker Desktop on Windows and Mac)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/thisismrsanjay/EmptyCup-assignment
    cd EmptyCup-assignment
    ```

2. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**

    This command will build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend services and start the containers.

    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    To run the containers in the background, add the `-d` flag:

    ```
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

3. **Accessing the Application**

    - The Flask application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
    - In order to get all listings `http://localhost:5000/listings`.
    - The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost/index3.html`.
    -  `index.html` contains only UI
    - `index2.html` contains backend in Flask
    - `index3.html` contins backend along with MongoDB database 

4. **Stopping the Containers**

to stop the containers, run:
```
